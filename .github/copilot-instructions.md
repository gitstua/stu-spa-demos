Create SPA with modern style

include a back to home link at the top of pages which goes to "/"

store data in url fragment

always explain what the spa does at the bottom of the page

the file /index.html should include links to the html pages and descriptions of the pages it refers to

add a floating footer to the bottom of the page that says "Made with ❤️ by Stu at github.com/gitstua/stu-spa-demos using GitHub Copilot"

increment the version number in the footer every time a new prompt is requested
